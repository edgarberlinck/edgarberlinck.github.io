Starships - The game
====================

This game still in development stage. I'm looking for people who want to help.
I did some basics and forked from my personal repository (http://github.com/edgarberlinck/edgarberlinck.github.io/tree/master/nave-2.0.0/).

DONE:
 - Basic game engine
 - Loading all resources
 - Change the main menu to use canvas drawnigs only and remove the Html tags.
 - When the user selects the "New Game" item, show the "select your starship" screen.
 - Now the game window resize with browser (min width and height is 500px)
 - Show the 'heroes' on 'select your starship window'
 - Added 'Ensure.js' support to load the stages files on demand
 - Start the game (Stage 1) 
 - MachineGun working
 - The shoot interval are not working rigth. See the TODOS on 'machinegun.js' for details.
 - Stage 1: Create Enemies
TO-DO NEXT:
 - Colision system
 - Stage 1: Create a Boss
 - Colision and Effects
 - Stage 1: Create Scenario
 - Create the Missle class
 - Create the Laser class

 TO-DO Later
 - Each hero must have his own class. This class must initialize all hero's attributes.
 - Play "Intro" when the main menu is rendered
 - Play "Menu select sound" when the user select other menu
 - Play "Menu selected" when the user shot "Enter"
 - Create Enemies
